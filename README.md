# P2P-Arbitrage-Spread-Calculator
A simple and user-friendly Crypto Arbitrage Calculator built using Python and Tkinter. This tool helps crypto traders (especially in P2P markets) calculate spread, ROI, and daily/monthly profits when buying and selling USDT at different rates.

📈 P2P Arbitrage Spread & Profit Calculator 🪙
Project Description
This GUI application is designed for cryptocurrency arbitrage traders in Pakistan (or similar PKR-based markets). 
It calculates the profit spread between the buying and selling rates of USDT, along with key financial metrics such as:

- Spread per USDT
- USDT bought with current capital
- Profit per trade
- Daily and monthly profit (based on trades per day)
- Return on Investment (ROI %)

This can help you make better decisions in manual or automated arbitrage setups using platforms like Binance, OKX, or other P2P exchanges.

🧮 Example Calculation
If:
- Buy Rate = 284
- Sell Rate = 291
- Capital = 100,000 PKR
- Trades per day = 5

Then the app will compute:
- Spread = ₨7
- USDT Bought = 352.11
- Profit per Trade = ₨2,464.77
- Daily Profit = ₨12,323.85
- Monthly Profit = ₨369,715.38
- ROI = 2.46% per trade
